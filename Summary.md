# SUMMARY

## Stakeholder-Value Matrix

Write a Stakeholder-Value Matrix for your sorting criteria below. Include at least three values and at least five stakeholders.

Please answer all the questions below after writing the stakeholder-value matrix. Please put your answers *after* the italicized instructions.

## Urgency Ranking Rationale  
*Explain your urgency ranking system for the 311 case categories. For each category you ranked, provide your reasoning based on factors like public safety, health impacts, economic consequences, equity issues, community impact, and infrastructure concerns. Include your complete ranking (1=most urgent, higher numbers=less urgent) and justify why you prioritized certain issues over others.*  
[15 points]  
*Answer:*

**My Urgency Rankings:**
1. [Category Name] - [Your reasoning]
2. [Category Name] - [Your reasoning]
3. [Category Name] - [Your reasoning]
...
[Continue for all categories you ranked]

**Overall Ranking Philosophy:**
[Explain your general approach to prioritization]

## Data Analysis Results

### Above-Average Case Duration Analysis
*Report your findings about cases that remain open longer than average. Which neighborhoods have the most cases that stay open longer than average? What patterns do you observe?*  
[10 points]  
*Answer:*

### Category Priority Analysis  
*Based on your analysis of average days open per category, which categories appear to get priority (resolved quickly) and which appear to be neglected (take longer to resolve)? How does this compare to your urgency rankings?*  
[10 points]  
*Answer:*

### Neighborhood Volume Analysis
*Which neighborhoods have the highest and lowest volumes of 311 cases? What might this suggest about service needs, access to 311 systems, or reporting patterns?*  
[10 points]  
*Answer:*

## Ethical Reflections

### Bias in Your Ranking System
*Critically examine your own urgency ranking. What biases might be embedded in your choices? Who might benefit or be disadvantaged by your prioritization system? Consider factors like socioeconomic status, race, age, disability, and other demographic characteristics.*  
[10 points]  
*Answer:*

### Systemic Equity Issues
*Based on your data analysis, what patterns suggest potential inequities in city service delivery? Do you see evidence of certain neighborhoods being consistently underserved? What are the potential causes and consequences of these patterns?*  
[10 points]  
*Answer:*

### Alternative Approaches
*What alternative approaches to prioritizing 311 cases might be more equitable? How could cities improve their service delivery to address the disparities you observed?*
